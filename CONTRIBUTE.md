Here how can you contribute:

- Need a feature? ask for it, or just fork the project (it has MIT license afterall)

- Find a bug? make a ticket, I'll fix it (or even better do a pullrequest with the patch)

- If you find compiler warnings when compiling client code report (I'll try to immediatly fix them)

- compiler warnings when compiling the library will be fixed but with less priority


I DO NOT:

- accept binaries, compiling the library is REALLY EASY. for security a maintanability
reasons the library come with build scripts only.
