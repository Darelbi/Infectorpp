I developed Infectorpp and the offical repo was this one: https://code.google.com/p/infectorpp/
Now I'm developing Infectorpp2 and the official repository is this one. 

Reason:
Version 1 had a number of issues that could be addressed only after a heavy refactoring session (redo from scratch) wich is what I'm actually doing. It also has a number of enanchments and features.
